# Licenta

The code to this project is unavailable due to it being property of Nokia. I signed an NDA and am not allowed to offer the code, but I am allowed to present the application and show the code if necessary.

The first step in running the application is to move to the sourcecode folder and install the dependencies by running the following command:
      npm install

The second step is to build the application by running the command below to create a production environment:
      npm run build
